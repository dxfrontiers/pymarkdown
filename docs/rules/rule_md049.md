## Summary

Ensure that all references to parts of the documentation are valid.

## Reasoning
### Ensuring Correctness

Invalid URLs for links and images can be a significant issue in documentation. 
Manually validating each link and image is a time-consuming task. 
With this rule, you can automatically validate the references to various parts of the documentation,
such as links and images. 

This helps to ensure the correctness and integrity of the documentation by identifying and flagging any invalid or broken references.
